# Facebook-Recommendation-Ranking
To develop  a Facebook Marketplace Search Ranking, in which the user develops and trains a multimodal model that accepts images and text. The output of the model generates embedding vectors that are helpful to make recommendations to buyers using their demographic information.  Once the model is trained, it can be deployed, so itâ€™s prepared to accept requests from potential buyers. The way you have to deploy it is by creating an API using FastAPI, containerising it using Docker, and uploading it to an EC2 instance. The API will contain all the models you create and train, so any new request can be processed to make predictions on the cloud. To ensure that the model can be easily modified without building a new image again, the files corresponding to each model are bound to the Docker image, so it allows you to update the models with retrained models even after deploying them.
