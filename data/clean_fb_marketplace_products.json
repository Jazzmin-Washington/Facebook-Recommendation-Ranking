You get two single chairs(not 4) and the sofa seating and the table. So this is a four piece set. We bought this as an anniversary gift for the parents but after building just the one chair we felt the set would be too small for their huge garden. This looked too small for us. Due to an immediate family loss by the time we opened the box, was too late to return. They won\u2019t take it back. This would suit a small to medium size garden or a small patio area. We need a large family set for our garden. The colour of set is dark brown. We bought it for \u00a3300 plus another \u00a320 for the waterproof cover. I\u2019m willing to sell this for \u00a3190 with the cover thrown in at no cost. ***Collection only***.

The natural characteristics of the wood sometimes brings small cracks, some waves in the boards, small gaps and ridges between them. As the moisture leaves the wood in your room they can bow to their permanent position. The tables are very strong and will last years and are made with the most amount of passion we can muster!!!!\r  You are also welcome to customise the size, wood, legs and chairs so get in touch to discuss what size best works for you!\r  -----------------------\r   ABOUT US\r Artemis London is a small family business, we love making furniture!\r We spend most of our day in the workshop and not so much at the computer, with this in mind we have compiled a list of answers to frequently asked questions and tried to be as extensive as possible with descriptions to minimise time spent at the screen and maximise time spent making furniture which is what we do best. We\u2019d love to make furniture for you and would really appreciate you taking a couple of minutes to read through everything to answer any questions you may have.\r Our design is inspired by nature and the timeless comforting beauty of wood.\r There is something special about sitting at a wooden handmade table to study, eat or share moments with family and friends that cannot be replicated, it has a feeling and an energy that adds to the atmosphere rather like an old, wise, silent friend that will age with you and be a companion of many seasons.\r WOOD USED\r We Use Kiln Dried Scandinavian Pine that has been slowly grown for over 60 years. Our Wood is sustainably sourced so more trees are planted than we use. For every tree felled, three are planted in its stead which means your furniture comes from positive regenerating forests which have a net reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere equivalent to the total carbon dioxide emissions of their country of growth - which we think is great!!! Further to this, the furniture is built from raw materials, the best in class and built to last!\r WOOD CHARACTERISTICS\r Raw wood furniture will have its own characteristics and personality, from saw marks to milling marks, dents, knots, splits, cracks and missing knots to butterfly and round knots and different coloured grains and textures. Some of these will be the nature of the wood and others from our manufacturing. By nature, like fingerprints, no piece of wood will be the same, each piece will be unique with its own story. Our style is industrial and rustic, with clean finishes and raw undertones. The wood used for your furniture may have any or all of these characteristics, anything you receive is intentional and quality checked before leaving the workshop to ensure it is of the Artemis standard. Sometimes there are kinks or bends in areas of the wood such as the table edges by a few degrees from flat, this is cosmetic only and part of the charm or raw wood! We balance out all our furniture pieces to ensure they are perfectly stable when they are set up.\r  WOOD MOVEMENT\r No matter how old or new, a wooden piece of furniture will keep reacting to its environment and by doing so it can expand and contract with the seasons and changes in humidity. If the environment of your space changes, the wood adapts to this. The wood used for your furniture is kiln dried to 10% moisture, so 10% of the wood is water. In your care guide that you receive with your order there will be tips and advice on how to keep your furniture in the same condition you received it in, taking different environments into consideration. While this is a significant departure from normal high street wooden furniture, with a little of the right care they will last many years to come!\r One of the main reasons as to why production of furniture moved to MDF, chipboard, plywood and veneers and other materials is because they don\u2019t behave like real wood and will remain the same once installed in place. The nature of the wood used for your furniture is the same as all other wood, they are universally shared characteristics.\r Please bear this in mind when choosing, wooden furniture can move in winter when there is more humidity in the air and the summer when it is more dry and will continue to move for as long as it exists. A settling period of several months will allow your furniture to become part of your space, if during this period you see your table moving around please refer to the care guide for advice and recommendations.\r MEASUREMENTS\r All lengths are available but the standard size is predetermined by the depth of the wood - unless you would like a bespoke size piece for your space which we can also accommodate.\r To find your preferred length select from the drop down menu and choose, this will also show you the variation in price based on your selections.\r If you cannot find your measurement please get in touch with us and we\u2019ll do everything we can to help and get you your perfect piece!\r  FURNITURE LEGS\r We have a variety of legs, please look at our choices! Each piece we send out will have the pilot holes pre-drilled for you, you\u2019ll need a screwdriver to set your furniture up. This is very easy, should your furniture be missing any pilot holes, the wood is quite soft and won\u2019t provide too much resistance to securing the legs to the wood. You can continue to do this by-hand in a matter of minutes no matter you skill level or strength. It\u2019s rare we miss out pilot holes, and easily rectifiable with a screwdriver, this won\u2019t damage the wood and will give a secure fit. You will receive a details set-up guide with your order.\r The furniture legs and build of the furniture are standardised to the industry norms for height. Any chair you would like to match from your own style choice will suit. On your furniture there may be an incremental adjustment in place between the legs and the table to ensure your furniture is perfectly balanced when set-up. Further details of this can be found in our set-up guide.\r COLOURS\r We have four choices of colours which you can choose from the drop down menu or add to your order notes, most of our pieces are treated with our Etna finish. There are three alternatives to this, Lily, Siena and Dolce.\r TREATMENT\r We treat the wood with a natural wax and oil based treatment which protects from water damage and stains and resists scratches, adds tone and gives a lovely satin finish, it also smells amazing! This treatment is very hardwearing and durable. For longevity, we advise treating it with care. If you love the super rustic style, you can leave it to develop the signs of use, it still looks wonderful! This treatment is designed for indoor furniture.","707":"We're getting More & More Recycling Bags & Boxes...\r Are you 'Blue Bag' Ready?\r For many of us, if not already, Our Bins, Boxes & Bags will soon be on a 3 Weekly Collection.

The natural characteristics of the wood sometimes brings small cracks, some waves in the boards, small gaps and ridges between them. As the moisture leaves the wood in your room they can bow to their permanent position. The tables are very strong and will last years and are made with the most amount of passion we can muster!!!!\r Before delivery can send you photos of your furniture\r You are also welcome to customise the size, wood, legs and chairs so get in touch to discuss what size best works for you!\r -----------------------\r   ABOUT US\r Artemis London is a small family business, we love making furniture!\r We spend most of our day in the workshop and not so much at the computer, with this in mind we have compiled a list of answers to frequently asked questions and tried to be as extensive as possible with descriptions to minimise time spent at the screen and maximise time spent making furniture which is what we do best. We\u2019d love to make furniture for you and would really appreciate you taking a couple of minutes to read through everything to answer any questions you may have.\r Our design is inspired by nature and the timeless comforting beauty of wood.\r There is something special about sitting at a wooden handmade table to study, eat or share moments with family and friends that cannot be replicated, it has a feeling and an energy that adds to the atmosphere rather like an old, wise, silent friend that will age with you and be a companion of many seasons.\r WOOD USED\r We Use Kiln Dried Scandinavian Pine that has been slowly grown for over 60 years. Our Wood is sustainably sourced so more trees are planted than we use. For every tree felled, three are planted in its stead which means your furniture comes from positive regenerating forests which have a net reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere equivalent to the total carbon dioxide emissions of their country of growth - which we think is great!!! Further to this, the furniture is built from raw materials, the best in class and built to last!\r WOOD CHARACTERISTICS\r Raw wood furniture will have its own characteristics and personality, from saw marks to milling marks, dents, knots, splits, cracks and missing knots to butterfly and round knots and different coloured grains and textures. Some of these will be the nature of the wood and others from our manufacturing. By nature, like fingerprints, no piece of wood will be the same, each piece will be unique with its own story. Our style is industrial and rustic, with clean finishes and raw undertones. The wood used for your furniture may have any or all of these characteristics, anything you receive is intentional and quality checked before leaving the workshop to ensure it is of the Artemis standard. Sometimes there are kinks or bends in areas of the wood such as the table edges by a few degrees from flat, this is cosmetic only and part of the charm or raw wood! We balance out all our furniture pieces to ensure they are perfectly stable when they are set up.\r  WOOD MOVEMENT\r No matter how old or new, a wooden piece of furniture will keep reacting to its environment and by doing so it can expand and contract with the seasons and changes in humidity. If the environment of your space changes, the wood adapts to this. The wood used for your furniture is kiln dried to 10% moisture, so 10% of the wood is water. In your care guide that you receive with your order there will be tips and advice on how to keep your furniture in the same condition you received it in, taking different environments into consideration. While this is a significant departure from normal high street wooden furniture, with a little of the right care they will last many years to come!\r One of the main reasons as to why production of furniture moved to MDF, chipboard, plywood and veneers and other materials is because they don\u2019t behave like real wood and will remain the same once installed in place. The nature of the wood used for your furniture is the same as all other wood, they are universally shared characteristics.\r Please bear this in mind when choosing, wooden furniture can move in winter when there is more humidity in the air and the summer when it is more dry and will continue to move for as long as it exists. A settling period of several months will allow your furniture to become part of your space, if during this period you see your table moving around please refer to the care guide for advice and recommendations.\r MEASUREMENTS\r All lengths are available but the standard size is predetermined by the depth of the wood - unless you would like a bespoke size piece for your space which we can also accommodate.\r To find your preferred length select from the drop down menu and choose, this will also show you the variation in price based on your selections.\r If you cannot find your measurement please get in touch with us and we\u2019ll do everything we can to help and get you your perfect piece!\r  FURNITURE LEGS\r We have a variety of legs, please look at our choices! Each piece we send out will have the pilot holes pre-drilled for you, you\u2019ll need a screwdriver to set your furniture up. This is very easy, should your furniture be missing any pilot holes, the wood is quite soft and won\u2019t provide too much resistance to securing the legs to the wood. You can continue to do this by-hand in a matter of minutes no matter you skill level or strength. It\u2019s rare we miss out pilot holes, and easily rectifiable with a screwdriver, this won\u2019t damage the wood and will give a secure fit. You will receive a details set-up guide with your order.\r The furniture legs and build of the furniture are standardised to the industry norms for height. Any chair you would like to match from your own style choice will suit. On your furniture there may be an incremental adjustment in place between the legs and the table to ensure your furniture is perfectly balanced when set-up. Further details of this can be found in our set-up guide.\r COLOURS\r We have four choices of colours which you can choose from the drop down menu or add to your order notes, most of our pieces are treated with our Etna finish. There are three alternatives to this, Lily, Siena and Dolce.\r TREATMENT\r We treat the wood with a natural wax and oil based treatment which protects from water damage and stains and resists scratches, adds tone and gives a lovely satin finish, it also smells amazing! This treatment is very hardwearing and durable. For longevity, we advise treating it with care. If you love the super rustic style, you can leave it to develop the signs of use, it still looks wonderful! This treatment is designed for indoor furniture.","816":"\u00a310Collection CB18QJText only 07788151973 3 Drawers 1 Door USED.

It is only 3 months old and has been very lightly used. It consists of the FlashForge Creator Pro 2 3d printer with software and accessories and the filament shown (mostly unopened). It is all in a very good used condition and would retail at approx. \u00a3700 for everything. I am looking for \u00a3400 O.N.O\r Description\r The Creator Pro 2 is the upgraded version of the classic Creator Pro with an independent dual extruder system. This means that productivity is much higher.\rIndependent dual extruder\rCompared to its predecessor, the Creator Pro 2 has two independently working extruders. This technology enables many practical advantages. With it, you can print two duplicates or mirrored objects at the same time and you need the same amount of time as if you print an object with a normal 3D printer.\rAnother advantage is that you can use it to process two different colours or materials in one printing process. This is very useful when you need supports for more complex objects that are removed after printing. This allows you to use special support materials that are water-soluble or easy to remove.\rHigh-stability\rThe Creator Pro 2 has a solid metal frame and sturdy Z-axis guide rods that ensure high stability and precision.\rIn addition, the Creator Pro 2 builds on the design of its predecessor with an enclosed build space, with which materials such as ABS can be printed much better and more efficiently. An enclosed build space minimises warping and enables excellent 3D printing results.\rAnti-scrape design\rWhen printing with a dual extruder, the two extruders alternate during the printing process. The anti-scrape design has been completely redesigned so that no flowing material residues from the stationary extruder destroy the print. This prevents oozing.\rMain features:\r\u2022\tEasy assembly\r\u2022\tHeated bed up to 120 \u00b0 C\r\u2022\tNozzle temperature up to 240 \u00b0 C\r\u2022\tBuild volume: 200 x 148 x 150 mm\r\u2022\tBuild space duplicate mode: 95 x 148 x 150 mm\r\u2022\tBuild space mirror mode: 80 x 148 x 150 mm\r\u2022\tNew touch screen for easier operation\r\u2022\tUSB and SD connection\r   ","2112":"Country Artists Meerkats\rH 17\"\rW 10\"\rD 7\"\rExcellent condition\rBuyer collects \/ cash payment preferred","2113":"Hi, this was my mum\u2019s pride and joy.

Each time you brush the sonic vibrations work hard to tackle stains on the surface of the tooth while the blue-light energises and accelerates the PAP whitening process. In addition, the Fluoride particles within the toothpaste renew and remineralise tooth enamel while keeping your mouth clean, healthy and fresh.To use: Use the STYLSMILE toothbrush and toothpaste twice per day, every day for 2 minutes.Apply the STYLSMILE toothpaste to the full length of the toothbrush bristles.Press and hold the power button for 2 seconds to turn on the toothbrush, press once for a fast speed or twice for a slower speed.Brush teeth in circular motions for 2 minutes, please note the toothbrush will pulse every 30 seconds.Use the 30-second pulses as a guide to brush the four sections of your mouth, move the toothbrush and brush the next section after each pulse. The toothbrush will automatically turn o\u00adff after 2 minutes.A flashing blue light around the power button indicates the STYLSMILE toothbrush needs to be recharged.

Impress with high quality, Caf\u00e9 style coffee, without the need for training.\r It uses a built in water tank, which means it can be deployed anywhere there is an electrical connection (does not need mains water or to be plumbed in).  \r Touch screen operation and fully adjustable coffee types, milk volumes, coffee strengths etc. Has decaf capability without the need to empty bean containers and even has a separate hot water nozzle to supply hot water for teas too.  \r You can also control remotely using its app from a separate phone \\ tablet, allowing you to charge for a coffee then start the brewing remotely from your till.  \r It has been operating in an extremely soft water area with very low mains water particulates, so it is in great shape inside and out.\r Wide range of popular drinks including Latte, Cappuccino, Expresso and many more.\r Comes with the Jura milk fridge** and a good amount of cleaning tablets and consumables.  Ready to brew with no activity and no need to buy cleaning materials initially.\r It produces fantastic tasting coffee, with minimal effort and it looks cool too!     We simply don't do the volume of coffee to justify it any more and are switching to a smaller machine.  Will be sorry to see it go.  Priced to sell quickly (new costs in excess of \u00a35,000 with the milk fridge).\r **Please note the milk fridge has developed a common fault which can lead to milk freezing if left in the fridge unit for a prolonged time (i.e. overnight).  It didn't bother us as we emptied the milk and refreshed daily.\r  ","3563":"Used for about 1 year, still in warranty, in perfect condition, only selling due to kitchen renovation where we\u2019ll have a built-in dishwasher.

I'm selling two Limited Edition 4k collectors blu ray Steelbooks. Both Limited to 850 copies. Both still brand new! Steelbooks haven't been opened, as you can see on those photos. I'm selling American Gangster, & Hellboy 2. Both with collectable items inside Both. Both have ridged gloss metal style on both packaging in photo. Honestly there's alot of stuff inside with a plastic credit card style card, with the number on it, out of 850. Both prices are on ZAVVI ONLINE. They will explain what's inside better than I can. As you can see in the photos, there's alot. I'm only asking for \u00a350 ono, no stupid offers, for Both. Hellboy 2, price is \u00a354.99. American Gangster is \u00a349.99. You can check ZAVVI online aswel. I'm being honest here now. I'm asking that price because I've taken the plastic foil off both box sets, only too check what's inside. As you can see, the Steelbook 4k is still wrapped up brand new. Literally everything is basically new. I didn't open up those envelopes seals. That's a bargain price for any 4k blu ray collectors out there. I'm selling because I'm moving into a smaller flat & i don't have much room for all my movie collection. Thank you.

The house is very dull, except for a large, ornate wardrobe discovered by young Lucy during a game of hide-and-seek. Venturing inside of it in the hopes of finding a hiding place, Lucy is transported to a snowy alternate universe: a magical world called Narnia. The land is populated by talking animals and ruled over by the benevolent lion god Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), but sadly, the world is also in a state of perpetual winter. The white witch Jadis (Tilda Swinton), lustful for power and governed by narcissism, has cursed Narnia with a tyrannical decree that it will always be winter but never Christmas. Now, the children must fight alongside Aslan for the salvation of Narnia, but one of them, seduced by the charisma of the white witch, may choose to fight on the wrong side.","3888":"Claire Douglas paperback - The Couple at No.9.

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.From the rear of the box:\r Howden, originally Heaffudene, grew at a crossing point (Bridgewater) along the Old Derwent (Hailgate) after Lake Humber had started to silt up.\r The town has a history that starts before the Domesday Book and has several royal connections, King Edgar gave his first wife Howden Manor, William the Conqueror gave the church (later developed into the Minster) to the Bishop of Durham and King John gave Howden the right to hold an annual horse fair.\r Howden was a coaching town and although it does not have a railway, it is the M62 that brings people here today. visitors can enjoy the Georgian architecture around the Minster, shops and cafes around the Market Place, a community venue in the Shire Hall, a walk around the nature reserve of Howden Marsh or recreational time in The Ashes.\r Local firms have helped to bring Howden MONOPOLY to fruition to celebrate Ash's 90th anniversary.

With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Hero Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world.

Smith shows how misogyny has assumed new and dangerous forms as we confront an economic, social and religious backlash. \r But that's only part of the story. The female eunuch has become the public woman, and she isn't going to go quietly.

Howe presents the most complete book-length exegesis of the research and theory concerning the emergence and development of declarative, long-term memory from birth through early adolescence. The book also contains the first presentation of Howe's theory that memory is an adaptive mechanism that is used to guide the development and survival of the organism in an initially novel, yet changing environment. The book is divided into four parts: In the first part, Howe discusses why memory development is important; in the second, he discusses infantile amnesia and autobiographical memory; in the third part, Howe explores a series of key factors that have an impact on early memory development\u2015distinctiveness, emotion, stress, and early memory; and finally, he gives a detailed presentation of the theory of memory as an adaptation, and applies results to real-world problems. In addition to reviewing the basic-science research on both humans and nonhuman animals, Howe devotes a significant portion of the book to clinical and forensic topics, including the roles of stress and trauma in memory development, the development of false recollection, memory for traumatic experiences, the effects of depression, PTSD, and dissociation on early memory development, and nonhuman animal research on the nature of infantile amnesia. In bringing together this diverse-yet-influential body of literature, Howe presents a valuable resource for anyone interested in research on memory.","4081":"Hard back children's books \u00a33 each in good condition and well looked after.

Its collection remains a stylish barometer of the social and cultural changes that shaped the 20th century. Now, portrayed here are the great, the good, and the not so good. From princesses to rock stars, models to actors, society beauties to world leaders, these are figures who have made an enduring mark on their age. And just as the pictures are a Who's Who of the brilliant and beautiful, the selection of photographers is equally stellar. Daring, discerning, iconoclastic-here are the people who defined their art: Horst, Beaton, Steichen, Penn, Snowdon, Parkinson, Bailey, and Testino, to name but a few. A lavish pictorial record of a century and beyond, as stylish as those within its pages. Robin Derrick, Creative Director of British Vogue, and Robin Muir, the magazine's former picture editor, are the authors of Unseen Vogue, which People magazine hailed as 'a stunning visual catalog of fashion.'\rISBN: 0316725714 \rPublisher: Little, Brown Book Group \rHardcover : 352 pages \rLanguage: English \rDimensions: 9.8 x 12.1 x 1.1 inches ","4203":"DISNEY PIXAR INCREDIBLES 2 DVD IN VERY GOOD CONDITION\rFROM A SMOKE FREE HOME, CASH ON COLLECTION ONLY\rPLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THE OTHER ITEMS THAT I HAVE FOR SALE","4204":" Owned from new - Selling Collection\r This is a thick ( 719 pages ) weighty, solid book containing a biography of music icon John Lennon written by Albert Goldman, parts of which have been regarded as contentious down the years.

It has the latest shaped full 1080 HD anti-reflect 15.6 inch IPS (greater viewing angles) screen (Ratio 16:9, Res: 1920 x 1080 pixels), and a 120Hz response time which gives you a fraction of a second advantage over gamers who do not have such a fast response time. It has the latest full sized Island style spill resistant back-lit keyboard, with a separate numeric pad. The keyboard also has some useful function buttons for adjusting\/muting the audio and adjusting the screen brightness. The keyboard illumination has two levels of brightness and can be turned off, useful when on battery power as turning off the back light will prolong battery life.\r Performance wise, you will be astonished. At its' heart lays an 8th generation Intel i5-8300H processor, it is a quad core but has 8 threads so, it is seen by the system as an octa-core, see photo 5 above, it clearly shows 8 processors, also note from that photo it has every correct driver but, that is hardly surprising given this machine was built with Windows 10 on, it is now one of the few laptops able to upgrade to Windows 11 (see photo 4), if you so wish, personally I will wait a while before I upgrade as Windows 11, could be another Vista, or Windows 8 flop. The processor has a base frequency of 2.3GHz to conserve energy but, when the going gets tough, each of those processors will boost to.4GHz to meet the demand, 8 x 4GHz is the equivalent of 32GHz!!! which is absolutely awesome, I have been doing laptops daily for almost 10 years now and it is by far this is the fastest laptop I have ever encountered, it is faster than any i7 processor that predates it, which is helped by its' 8mb smart cache (instant ram). Combine this with 16GB of very fast DDR4 Ram (2666MHz), UHD 630 plus Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060  graphics and a SSD (there are no faster Hard Drives) and you have the kind of performance most folk can only dream about. The machine was primarily built for gaming but because the hardware is so good you will find it is able to run any Office type CAD programs, with ease. Like the processor,, the graphics (using a technology called optimus, will switch back and forth between graphics cards, when the power of the GTX 1060, is not needed, in order to conserve energy. There are two versions of the GTX 1060 card one has 3GB of its' own dedicated ultra fast GDDR5 ram and this one which has 6GB of it. 6GB of dedicated ram plus 16GB of system Ram, equals 22GB of ram, we are talking awesome figures here and those figures mean this rig will be able to play any game but, you will need to reduce the gaming resolution to as low as 720, in order to play some of the latest, most demanding triple A games.\r Despite its 15.6' screen this model weighs just 2.3KGs, so they are suitable for the daily commute. The programs I have installed will ensure it is equably capable whether at home, or in an office environment. \r For the new owner I have done a fresh install of Windows 10 (64 bit), and Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2019 (which includes both Visio and Project), both were then activated and fully updated. I then did the following: \r 1) It has a HD 720p camera and an internal microphone so, I installed Skype, for your free Skype to Skype video calls, this also enables Facebook video calling, Windows 10 has an app named camera, so I created a task bar short-cut link to it, which will make it very easy for you to create video's for work related tasks, or for posting onto your social network sites. \r 2) For ease of use and so you have a fully functioning laptop straight out the box. I have also installed Google Chrome, along side Internet Explorer and Edge (for decent browsing), I added Ad blocker to Chrome so that eliminates all those annoying pop-ups, I have also added an unlimited VPN to Chrome so, your privacy is assured when you wish it to be, Adobe reader for opening PDF files, 7-zip for compressing\/decompressing files, Gimp for your photo editing, Microsoft's Security Essentials, for your internet security, it has very powerful Dolby enhanced speakers so I installed iTunes and put about four hundred songs in there to get you started, Driver Booster (to ensure you always have the latest Drivers) and last but, not least, a very good PC health care program, run this every few weeks and the laptop's operating system will always be in tiptop condition. Self praise is no recommendation but I am pretty good with laptops so no rubbish has been downloaded with any of these programs. \r 3) For your Home Entertainment I have installed Kody, and have properly set it all up. It is the worlds best media centre, it gives you access to all the latest movies, live TV, documentaries, 1000's of radio stations, etc.. etc... Very easy to use for streaming or downloading and it is completely free. Say goodbye to monthly subscriptions, you will not need them when you have this and bonus, this one has a HDMI port so, for family viewing, both the video and audio can be cast onto your TV in HD with just one lead, plus it has wireless monitor tech so, if your TV lists Wireless Display, Miracast or Mirroring under sources you can connect to it wireless. \r Interfaces: \r2 USB 3.2 Gen 1;\r1 USB 2.0; \r1 HDMI; \r1 RJ-45; \r1 headphone\/microphone combo\rit is also Wi-Fi and Blue-Tooth enabled.\r This laptop comes to you with its' original 7.7Amp Asus branded charger and a its' original battery which, as you can see in photo 13 above, will last you up to 2hours 55 mins. That reading was taken with the back-lit keyboard turned off and the screen on 100% brightness so, you might squeeze up to 3.5 hours if you dim the screen a little.\r To arrange a meeting and to put this laptop through its' paces, text me (John) on the above number, no calls please as I am usually busy . You will not be disappointed, everything is in perfect running order, it looks stylish, is well built and gives absolutely awesome performance. A bargain at \u00a3545, so no offers please\r PS It has 2 hard drives, a 256GB SSD onto which I have installed the Operating System for super fast speeds and a 1TB for storage.","4830":"Ryzen 1700x 8 Core\/16 Thread CPU.16gb 3000mhz Corsair Ram.GTX 1060 3gb Graphics Card.ASRock B450 Gaming ITX\/AC Motherboard.250gb SSD.1tb HDD.Corsair 450w Power Supply.Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.Cooler Master Elite 110 ITX Case.Noctua NH-L12s Low Profile Cooler.Windows 10.Great Mid\/High range PC, great for video editing, streaming and gaming.

The tests implemented by more than 1000 users show that this blackhead vacuum can effectively remove stubborn blackheads, whiteheads, dead skin, grease and makeup residues, smooth wrinkles, and tighten their skin after continuously using it for 2 - 5 weeks.\r 3 Modes: 3 Different kinds of powerful suction levels are designed for different types of skin to achieve genuine deep cleaning. You can easily find the most appropriate suction level for your different skin areas, which can effectively remove the oil, impurities, and dust particles in the clogged pores.\r 6 Suction Heads: Each suction head has different functions. Choosing different suction heads according to different skin types and skin areas is more effective to solve skin problems in different parts of the face.\r Safe to Use: The physical approach is adopted to solve skin problems without any chemicals that are toxic and harmful. One suction, negative pressure in the core hole, directly reaches the root of the blackhead; the pressure is automatically released without leaving red and purple scars; \rOnce closed, the pores will be constricted, and the secondary black build-up will be avoided. It is safer and more effective than the traditional facial cleaning method.\r Home & Travel Use: This blackhead remover tool conforms to the principles of ergonomic design, ultra-light, and portable design makes you enjoy professional skincare at home or travel.\r Specifications:\rInput Power: 2.5W\rRated Voltage: 3.7V\rSwitch Type: Button\rCharging Time: about 90Mins\rSuction Force: \u226453KPA\rProduct Size: about 17 x 4.5cm\/6.7 x 1.8in\r ****ITEM IS BRAND NEW *******\r Package Contents:\r 1 x Blackhead Remover\r6 x Suction Heads\r1 x USB Cable\r1 x Users Manual","5433":"Med-Fit\u00ae Wireless Rechargeable Mini TENS And Muscle Stimulator-Treats Back Pain, Sciatica, Neck, knee, Arthritis And Muscle pain, Ideal for stressed and sore muscles","5434":"New Braun shaver series 5 .

Toitogo Ltd\rFIRST CHOICE\rthe black truffle melanosporum is the most prized kind of truffle (absolutely not to be confused with the scorzone or summer truffle). It is widespread in Italy, in De Luca Estates. Its scent is pleasantly intense, aromatic and fruity. Many people prefer the prized black truffle to the white truffle thanks to its particular sweet taste which, at times, recalls chocolate (it is in fact also called sweet black). The black truffle expresses all its elegance once cooked but is also pleasant raw. Also remember to wash the black truffle only before its use. The best way to enjoy the prized black truffle is on top of the egg (with any type of cooking). You can also use the prized black truffle to season a pasta dish (see our truffle pasta) or on top of red meat (carpaccio, tartare, tagliata). Finally, don't forget to add the sauce par excellence to the pasta or meat: our truffle butter.\r Harvesting period in the Marche region: 1st December - 15th March\r > SELECT THE TOTAL WEIGHT YOU WANT TO BUY: 50-100-200-300-400-500-1000 gr\r we ship directly from Italy to all England\rstarting from 50 gr      65 GBP \r","6493":"A pair of office swivel chairs.

Sadly I have grown up and need to clear space, hence the sale \ud83d\ude0a\r It is in fantastic condition, everything works and I'll miss it! Grab it now as there aren't many of these around.\r Perfect for the man-cave!!\r I live in east Sussex but the table is located with family in North East London and can be collected from there once deal agreed.\r Some blurb below from the guys who made it...\r The Lizard Lounge Digital Table is a totally authentic reproduction of the original tabletop arcade games that were present in every self-respecting pub and club in the 1980s. Officially known as 'cocktail' cabinets, the games achieved cult status with classic titles like 'Space Invaders', 'Donkey Kong' and 'Track & Field', played face to face across the table rather than upright in the usual arcade style.\r Few of the original consoles have survived to the present day - most were destroyed or scavenged for spares as newer games were developed - but there is still a massive following for the consoles and the original games.\r So Lizard Lounge decided to build their own. The result is a hand-built, lovingly crafted replica of the original tables. Having developed the initial prototypes, the designs were finalised by the same company that used to supply commercial arcade systems to Nintendo and Sega. Nothing has been overlooked - from the smoked-glass top down to the coin mechanism (with override), two-player control consoles and built in sound system.\r Internally, the Lizard Lounge is far from retro. Rather than utilising the original circuit designs, which would limit each console to playing a single game, Digital Tables have opted for PC technology and software emulation, with a high-spec PC fitted, running Windows XP together with arcade emulation software capable of playing almost 3,000 original arcade games.\r And the functionality doesn't end there. The Lizard Lounge Table can be used to do everything you would expect from a PC. In conjunction with its dedicated wireless keyboard and mouse you can run your office, or leave it to play your collection of MP3 songs as a virtual jukebox in the corner of the room.
